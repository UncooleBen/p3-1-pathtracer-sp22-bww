        <p>In part 1, we generated a ray from camera to image plane and transformed it to the world space. We also wrote
            ray-triangle and ray-sphere intersection tests, which are building blocks for ray-tracing rendering
            algorithms.</p>

        <p>Use this section to write an overview of the assignment. All of the text in your write-up should be <em>in
                your own words</em>. If you need to add additional HTML features to this document, you can search the <a
                href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a> website for instructions. To edit the
            HTML, you can just copy and paste existing chunks and fill in the text and image file names appropriately.
        </p>
        <o>The website writeup is intended to be a self-contained walkthrough of the assignment: we want this to be a
            piece of work which showcases your understanding of relevant concepts through both mesh images as well as
            written explanations about what you did to complete each part of the assignment. Try to be as clear and
            organized as possible when writing about your own output files or extensions to the assignment. We want to
            understand what you've achieved and how you've done it!</p>
            <p>If you are well-versed in web development, feel free to ditch this template and make a better looking
                page. Just make sure that you include all the components as we've laid them out here. </p>

            <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>
            <p>In task 1, we generated a ray from camera to image plane and transformed it to the world space. In task
                2, we uniformly sampled rays across every pixel on the image plane and averaged their evaluated color as
                the final color for the pixel. In task 3, we wrote a ray-triangle test which composes of: 1) ray-plane
                intersection; 2) point-in-triangle test using barycentric coordinates. In task 4, we wrote a ray-sphere
                test which uses the quadratic formula for the roots of quadratic equations.</p>

            <h2 align="middle">Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
            <p>
                In part 5, we implemented adaptive sampling using two helper variables <code>sample_sum</code> and
                <code>sample_squared_sum</code>, which is the s1 and s2 mentioned in the part 5 guideline. We update
                these two variables as we generate new pixel ray samples and use them to compute the indicator
                <code>I</code>. And the test whether it lies in the product of maxTolerance and mean. If so, we break
                out of the for loop and divide the accumulated radiance by the sample count so far.

            <div align="center">

            <p>
                We can see from the rate image that the three walls and the floor converges very quickly. This is
                reasonable since they receive direct strong radiance from the light source on the ceiling, making other
                lights bounce on them less important.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ceiling converges very slowly because there is hardly any direct lights bounce on it. Most of the
                radiance it receives is from more than one bounces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar observation applies on the bunny. The surfaces with top pointing normal converges quickly as
                most of the radiances come from the light source. However, other surfaces converge slowly because they
                are not directly lighted and need to be updated according to more than one bounces.
